Environment Variables

To list your environment variables here for quick reference, use the keyboard shortcut (For macOS, press 'Command-Shift-E' for Windows 'Ctrl-Shift-E') or choose Tools, Show Environment Variables.

Environment variables remain encrypted when listed in the console code editor. If you enabled encryption helpers for encryption in transit, then those settings remain unchanged. For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-envvars.html#configuration-envvars-encryption.
